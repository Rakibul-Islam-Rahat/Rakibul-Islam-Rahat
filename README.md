### 🧩 What I Do

I engineer **cross-platform mobile applications** powered by scalable and secure backend systems.  
With a solid foundation in Computer Science, I combine **clean UI development** with **modular backend architecture** to deliver apps that are not just functional — but built to last.

From startup MVPs to client-ready solutions, I work end-to-end: frontend, backend, API integration, and deployment.
